# Project Overview: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, containing information about passengers, including whether they survived or not. It includes features such as age, sex, ticket class, and embarkation point.

## Tasks

### Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Handle missing values.
- Explore data distributions and relationships.

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

### Data Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features if needed.

### Model Selection
- Choose and implement machine learning algorithms suitable for a binary classification task.

### Model Training
- Train the model on a subset of the data.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- Use cross-validation to ensure robust performance assessment.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize the model by adjusting hyperparameters.

### Model Interpretation
- Examine feature importance to understand which features contribute most to predictions.

## Outcome
The project aims to deliver a predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. Additionally, the project provides insights into the factors that played a significant role in determining survival, contributing to a deeper understanding of the historical event.
