# Project Overview: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, containing information about passengers, including whether they survived or not. It includes features such as age, sex, ticket class, and embarkation point.

## Tasks

### Problem Definition
- Quick overview of the problem to be solved

### Data Collection
- Get the available data

### Data Exploration and Preparation
- Handle missing values.
- Explore data distributions and relationships.

### Data Analysis
- Analyse the data to confirm the assumptions.

### Model building
- Train the model on a subset of the data.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- Use cross-validation to ensure robust performance assessment.

### Model Deployment
- Check the result in the test data.

## Outcome
The project aims to deliver a predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. Additionally, the project provides insights into the factors that played a significant role in determining survival, contributing to a deeper understanding of the historical event.
